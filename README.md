LISVAP
======

LISVAP is a model that produce Evaporation timeseries maps that can be used as input to Water Balance/Flood simulation models.

Reference values for potential evapotranspiration and evaporation are estimated using the Penman-Monteith equation (Supit et al., 1994, Supit & Van Der Goot, 2003)
